# Fiftygram
Final Project

This project is an implementation of an android filter app done on Android Studio. The app lets you select pictures from your photo library that will be displayed on the screen ready to be modified. There are 6 different filters available for the user to apply as soon as the picture is uploaded. Note that the picture will return to its original form before being modified again if the user decides to change filters; therefore, filters are only applied on the original photo uploaded. Finally, the user will be able to save the modified picture of his choice by clicking the “save” button under the filters; this will store the new image in a designated album in the photo library.

Everyone can run this app by opening the Fiftygram folder on Android Studio and clicking the play (triangle button) on the top right of the interface. A device should already exist for testing (Pixel 4 API 33). If not, you can very easily choosing a new device to display the app by going to “Device Manager” and selecting “Create device”.

The main implementation for this project (in Java) can be found under “app/java/edu.harvard.cs50.fiftygram/MainActivity”. To check out the how the layout of the app has been implemented go to “app/res/layout/activity_main.xml”.
